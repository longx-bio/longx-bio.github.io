As part of our mission to empower rising generations within the longevity sector, we **provide mentorship to high school and undergraduate students** to encourage an early interest in the field. One way to do so is by connecting them with the right **academia** and **industry**-based people and resources. Another way is by direct, case-by-case advising.

As we operate in stealth in our early stages, we work to provide feedback and guidance while they (the young enthusiasts) write articles on topics of their choice and interest, have them professionally reviewed, and then share them here. We also connect these students with relevant **resources and opportunities** along the way. 

Keep in touch with us to receive updates on our **collaborations** and **progress**!

## Deep dives
The topics we cover don't have to just scratch the surface of what is longevity about, and what one can do. 
Diving deeper into questions that spark your interest is beneficial for people with an obsession with the same questions that you have.


---

## Personal stories
As youngsters in the field, we also struggled to find role models our age. There is so much talent out there, this shouldn't be the case.

Did you do some cool longevity stuff or have unique ideas? Share your story and perspective!
Do you know someone else who falls into that category? Don't be afraid to interview them or share their work with us!


---

## Creative work
Did you ever search on Google for answers to a most random (longevity-related) shower thought? Did you jump into a deep rant about the topic? We want to cover that!


---

## Curated lists
We aim to share lists of resources anyone can use to expand their skills, gain experience, meet new longevity folks, and become who they want to be.
